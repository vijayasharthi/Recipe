        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ul>
           
            <li><b>Marinating the Chicken:</b></li>
In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt.
Mix well until the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably longer for the flavors to meld.
<br>
<br><li><b>Cooking the Rice:</b></li>
<li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil.
    <li>Add soaked rice, bay leaf, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cook rice until it's 70-80% done. It should still have a slight bite to it.</li>
            <li>Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
<li><b>Making the Biryani:</b></li>
<li>In a heavy-bottomed pan or a biryani pot, heat ghee or oil over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add thinly sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown and caramelized.</li>
        <li>Add marinated chicken pieces along with chopped tomatoes and slit green chilies.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken until it's almost done and the tomatoes are mushy.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle biryani masala, fried onions (if using), and half of the chopped cilantro and mint leaves. Mix well.</li>
                    <li>Layer half of the partially cooked rice over the chicken mixture.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle the remaining chopped cilantro and mint leaves on top of the rice.</li>
                            <li>Layer the remaining rice over the herbs.</li>
                                <li>If using saffron, drizzle the saffron-infused milk over the rice.</li>
                                    <li>Cover the pan tightly with a lid or aluminum foil to trap the steam.</li>
                                        <li>Cook biryani on low heat for 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked and the rice is tender.</li>
                                            <li>Once done, gently fluff up the biryani with a fork.</li>
                                                <li>Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) and salad on the side.</li>
