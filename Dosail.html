        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        
        <li> <b>Soaking:</b></li>
        
        Rinse 2 cups of rice and 1 cup of urad dal together until the water runs clear.
        Soak them in enough water, along with a teaspoon of fenugreek seeds, for about 6-8 hours or overnight.
<br>
<br>
        <li><b>Grinding:</b></li>
        
        After soaking, drain the water from the rice and lentils.
        Grind them together in a blender or wet grinder to a smooth batter consistency. Add water as needed while grinding.
        The batter should be thick yet pourable.
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><b>Fermentation:</b></li>
        
        Transfer the batter to a large bowl.
        Add salt to taste and mix well.
        Cover the bowl loosely with a lid or cloth.
        Leave the batter in a warm place to ferment for about 8-12 hours or until it doubles in volume. The time required for fermentation may vary depending on the temperature of your surroundings.
        <br>
        <br>

        <li><b>Making Dosai:</b></li>
        
        After fermentation, the batter will be airy and slightly sour smelling.
        Heat a dosa tawa (griddle) or a non-stick pan over medium heat.
        Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the tawa and spread it evenly in a circular motion to form a thin layer.
        Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa.
        Cook until the bottom side is <i><u>golden brown and crisp</u></i>.
        Flip the dosa and cook the other side for a minute or until it's cooked through.
        Repeat the process with the remaining batter.
        Dosai is typically served hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or any other accompaniment of your choice. Enjoy your dosai!</p>
