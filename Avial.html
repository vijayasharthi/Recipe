        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <li><b> Prepare the Vegetables:</b></li> Wash, peel (if required), and chop the vegetables into uniform-sized pieces. Traditionally, they are cut into long pieces.
        <br><br>
            <li><b> Cook the Vegetables: </b></li>In a pot, add the chopped vegetables with turmeric powder, salt, and enough water to cover them. Cook until the vegetables are tender but still firm.
            <br><br>
                <li><b>Prepare Coconut Paste:</b></li> Grind coconut, green chilies, and cumin seeds to a coarse paste without adding water.
                <br><br>
                    <li><b> Mix Coconut Paste and Vegetables:</b></li> Once the vegetables are cooked, add the coconut paste to the pot. Mix well.

                        <li><b>Add Yogurt:</b></li> After a couple of minutes, add the beaten yogurt to the pot. Stir gently to combine. Be cautious not to boil vigorously to prevent the yogurt from splitting.
                        <br><br>
                            <li><b>Tempering:</b></li> In a separate small pan, heat coconut oil. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then add curry leaves and fry for a few seconds. Pour this tempering over the avial.

                                <li><b>Serve:</b></li> Your avial is ready! Serve it hot with rice or enjoy it as a side dish with any Indian meal.
